# GraphTheoryProject

In this research project, I use jupyter notebook to cover the graph isomorphism problem, as well as, types of graphs, algorithms associated with it, permutations and groups and some other relevant material like a famous problem(Konigsberg Brigde Problem) and László Babai who solved the problem in Quasipolynomial Time. 

Jupyter notebook helps with writing html code for headings, getting pictures, which I saved in an 'Images' folder for easy access and sharing links which includes references located at the bottom of the notebook.

I also wrote code in python for this project which calculates isomorphism in two graphs with different algorithms and libraries such as networkX and iGraph, as well as code that calculates all automorphisms within a graph.
